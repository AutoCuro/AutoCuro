# PCB Design Automation - Generated Designs Repository

This repository contains PCB designs automatically generated using our PCB design automation platform. These designs demonstrate the capabilities of automated PCB layout, component placement, and routing for 
embedded hardware applications.

## About This Repository

The designs in this repository showcase:
- Automated component placement and routing
- Different embedded hardware applications (IoT devices, development boards, etc.)
- Design files compatible with major EDA tools (Altium, Cadence Allegro, KiCad)

## Repository Contents

- **Design Files/S32K396**: Altium placement file generated from our recreation of [STM32L496G-DISCO board](https://autocuro.com/case_studies/automated-placement-for-stm32l496g-disco)
