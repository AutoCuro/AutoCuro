This repository contains PCB designs automatically generated using our PCB design automation platform. These designs demonstrate the capabilities of automated PCB layout, component placement, and routing for 
embedded hardware applications.

## About This Repository

The designs in this repository showcase:
- Automated component placement and routing
- Different embedded hardware applications (IoT devices, development boards, etc.)
- Design files compatible with major EDA tools (Altium, Cadence Allegro, KiCad)

## Repository Contents

- **Design Files/S32K396**: Altium placement file generated from our recreation of [STM32L496G-DISCO board](https://autocuro.com/case_studies/automated-placement-for-stm32l496g-disco)
